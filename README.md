#### KMeans Clustering  

[k-means-clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
